# BeSTspeak

This is a very straightforward text to speech speak window that interfaces with Berkeley Speech Technologies' vintage BeSTspeech T-T-S speech synthesizer via API calls.

BeSTspeech has been used in both vintage hardware (such as the Keynote GOLD and the Franklin Language Master LM-4000) and software (Nisus Writer and Amazing Writing Machine).

Here is an audio clip showing off the voices:
