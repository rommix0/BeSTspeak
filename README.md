BeSTspeak Text-To-Speech speak window.

Very straightforward speak window that interfaces with Berkeley Speech Technologies' vintage BeSTspeech T-T-S speech synthesizer via API calls.

BeSTspeech has been used in both vintage hardware (such as the Keynote GOLD and the Franklin Language Master LM-4000) and software (Nisus Writer and Amazing Writing Machine).
